1.DEATHMATCH IN EARTQUAKE
       If you want to launch it, just run EARTHQUAKE go to NEW GAME,MULTIPLAYER,
       START MULTIPLAYER. After that enter the name of the map and press ENTER.
       But I think you will have to set some of the options before playing:
       a.) Name of 1 and 2 players
       b.) Name of 1 and 2 player's models

       After that setup run MULTIPLAYER.

       3.) Thunderbolt shoots far and good, nice weapon
       4.) Bombs are very powerful, but they have a short distance
       5.) You can attack your portner with axe close, that weapon is powerful
       6.) Yes baby, it's an old BFG 2000. It shoots very far and it's the most
       powerful weapon in all game. P.S(Eats lot's of cells, 30 to be exact)
       7.) This weapon shoots with rockets far and fast, but you must
       aim very good before attacking

       2.) Biosuit is a protection against slime and basic blaster. It also
       protects you from hot lava, but not completly.

       I CAN'T DRAW BIOSUIT!!!


       3.) Teleports are very important to. If you want to move yourself to
       another zone of the level.
